This PencilSimulator TDD Kata for applying to Pillar Technology was developed in
Java 1.8.0 using NetBeans 8.2 and packaged for convenient building in Gradle 4.10.1.

To run and certify that the tests pass simply pull this project to some 'DIRECTORY'.
Let DIRECTORY be a path, such as the following for the Windows 10 Machine I built it on:

"C:\Users\joexi\Documents\NetBeansProjects\PencilSimulator\"

In a terminal/command prompt/etc:

1.) navigate to DIRECTORY\pencilSimulatorGradle

2.) Enter the command "gradle build"

The build output should proclaim success, and also list the tests that were executed
for reference.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my employment at Pillar Technology.
